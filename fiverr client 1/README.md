# Digital Image Processing 
Assignment #4

Due: Tue 04/21/20 11:59 PM

1. Filtering:
Write code for computing median, max, min, alpha_trimmed, arithmetic_mean, geometric_mean and contra-harmonic filters. 
The input to your program is a 2D matrix.

  - Starter code available in directory Denoise/
      - \__init__(): Will intialize the required variable for filtering (image, filter_name, filter_size, alpha_p, order). There is no need to edit this function  
  - Denoise/Filtering.py: Edit the functions 'get_median_filter', 'get_min_filter', 'get_max_filter', 'get_alpha_filter', 'get_arithmetic_mean_filter', 'get_geo_mean_filter' and 'get_contra_harmonic_filter' you are welcome to add more function.
  - For this part of the assignment, please implement your own code for all computations, do not use built-in functions, like "medianBlur", "MaxFilter", "numpy.pad" from PIL, opencv or other libraries - that directly accomplish the objective of the question. You can use any math (import math) related functions such as "prod", "pow" and "sum".
    You can also make use python builtin functions such as "sorted", "max", "min" for order statistic filters. 
  
filtering(): Write your code to perform image denoising/filtering here using the previous implemented filters. The steps can be used as a guideline for filtering. All the variable have already been initialized and can be used as self.image, self.filter_name, etc. The variable self.filter is a handle to each of the seven filters functions. 
  - The function return the denoised image.
  - This part of the assignment can be run using dip_hw4_filter.py (there is no need to edit this file)
  - Usage: 
  
        ./dip_hw4_filter.py -m harmonic -i Lenna.png -n gaussian
        python dip_hw4_filter.py -m harmonic -i Lenna.png -n gaussian
        
  - Please make sure your code runs when you run the above command from prompt/terminal
  - Any output images or files must be saved to "output/" folder (dip_hw4_filter.py automatically does this)
  
-------------

Two images are provided for testing: Lenna.png and Lenna0.jpg  
PS. Files not to be changed: requirements.txt and Jenkins file 
  
1. Any output file or image should be written to output/ folder

The TA will only be able to see your results if these condition is met

1. Filtering       - 15 Pts.

    Total          - 15 Pts.
